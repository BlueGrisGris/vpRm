# vpRm
## Version 0.0.0.9000 "Picea Pungens"

# Introduction

VPRM (Vegetation Photosynthesis Respiration Model) is a model of NEE (Net Ecosystem Exchange) (Mahadevan et al 2008).  This R package handles the driver data and calculations to run a VPRM model

## Goals
This package should:
- Provide a single wrapper function to run VPRM within CONUS.
- Be modular and tolerant of different sources/forms for driver data.  If a new source for driver data is desired, it should be possible to slot in a new script for importing that data with minimal reconfiguration of the rest of the code. 
- Be semi-robust. I am a grad student, and this is one part of my research, but it should be useful to people with different computer systems than me within a reasonable amount of work.
